## Design Report

### Overview
For the Capstone Project - Part 2, the mockup of the web application was created using Figma. The design focuses on user experience and accessibility, ensuring the application is responsive and visually appealing across multiple devices.

### Design Elements
- **Colours**: The primary colour chosen is #3498db (blue) for its professional and calming effect. Secondary colours include #2ecc71 (green) for success messages and #e74c3c (red) for error messages.
- **Fonts**: The primary font is 'Roboto', chosen for its readability and modern appearance. Headers use a bold version of Roboto, while body text uses the regular version.
- **Branding**: A custom logo was designed to reflect the application's purpose and target audience. Icons were sourced from FontAwesome for consistency and recognizability.

### Responsive Design
Layouts were created for three primary screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: A full-featured layout with all elements visible.
- **Tablet**: A slightly condensed layout with a collapsible navigation bar.
- **Mobile**: A single-column layout with touch-friendly elements and a hamburger menu for navigation.

### Challenges and Solutions
One of the challenges was ensuring that the user experience remained consistent across different screen sizes. This was addressed by using a flexible grid system and media queries to adjust the layout as needed.
