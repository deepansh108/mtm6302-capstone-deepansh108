# Capstone Project - Part 3

## Objective
The objective of this part of the capstone project is to create a responsive and dynamic web application prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This prototype should closely match the mockup created in Part 2 of the project and demonstrate the culmination of skills learned in Web Development I, II, and III.

## Getting Started
To begin working on this part of the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a `part-3` branch from the `part-2` branch.
2. Switch to the `part-3` branch.

## Requirements
The prototype for this part of the project must meet the following requirements:

1. The prototype should consist of one HTML file (`index.html`) and one CSS file (`style.css`). Optionally, one JavaScript file (`script.js`) may be included in the project.
2. The prototype should closely match the mockup created in Part 2.
3. The prototype must be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.
4. Modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind may be used to enhance the design and responsiveness.
5. Ensure permission is obtained for any external resources used in the prototype.

## Report
### Steps Taken
1. **Branch Creation:**
   - Created a new branch `part-3` from the `part-2` branch.
   - Switched to the `part-3` branch to start the development of the prototype.

2. **HTML and CSS Development:**
   - Created the `index.html` file to structure the content of the web application.
   - Created the `style.css` file to style the web application according to the mockup.

3. **Responsiveness:**
   - Ensured the prototype is responsive by using media queries and flexible grid systems.
   - Tested the web application on various devices to ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes.

4. **CSS Frameworks:**
   - Utilized the Bootstrap framework to simplify the process of creating a responsive layout.
   - Integrated Bootstrap components to match the mockup design and enhance the overall appearance.

5. **JavaScript:**
   - Optionally added a `script.js` file to incorporate dynamic features and interactivity into the prototype.

### Resources Used
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring the prototype closely matched the mockup required meticulous attention to detail in both HTML structure and CSS styling.
- Achieving responsiveness across different devices involved extensive testing and adjustments to the CSS code.
- Integrating Bootstrap components while maintaining the custom styles from the mockup was challenging but provided a streamlined workflow for responsiveness.

## General Considerations
- Ensured the code is valid using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
- Properly formatted and indented the code to maintain readability and consistency.

## Submission
1. Created a commit with the message "Completes the assignment."
2. Pushed the `part-3` branch and all changes to GitHub.
3. Submitted the URL to the GitHub Repository.
